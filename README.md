# BookBae
- Book (*noun*): a set of written, printed, or blank sheets bound together between a front and back cover.
- Bae (*noun*): US Slang- sweetheart, baby. 'Before Anyone Else.' 

## About
If you love books, then you'll love BookBae! BookBae was inspired by my love of books, and my overwhelming guilt that I have so many of them, but seemingly so little time to read them all. BookBae was created in efforts to help users organize and keep track of their books. "It's like GoodReads but cuter." - a friend. 

## Made With
- React.JS & Redux for the front-end
- Ruby on Rails (Rails 5.2.2) for the back-end 
- Google Books API for all book related data (titles/authors/descriptions/thumbnails)

## Installation
- Back-end: 
```
bundle install
rails db:migrate
rails db:seed
rails s
```
- Front-end:
```
yarn install
yarn start
```
## To do
- Recommend related books
- Add followers/followees to user model
- Flesh out book review cards on front end
